        <p>
          <strong>Shuyu Zhang (张书语)</strong>, born in 2001 in Xining, Qinghai,
          China, is a child nurtured by the mountains. Her journey has taken her
          through the vibrant cities of Chengdu, Beijing, Nanning, and Suzhou in
          China, and she now lives and studies in London, UK.
        </p>

        <p>
          As an <strong>Interactive &amp; Spatial Experience Designer</strong> and
          <strong>Digital Artist</strong>, Shuyu's academic and creative
          pursuits consistently center on exploring the fascinating relationship
          between humans and the digital world. She is dedicated to innovating
          at the intersection of physical space and the virtual realm,
          constantly experimenting with mediums such as interactive
          installations, game experiences, and generative art as bridges for
          communication. Shuyu excels at rapid self-learning and integrating new
          technologies (Unity VR, TouchDesigner, motion capture, Arduino) to
          create compelling works that evoke immediate surprise and resonance in
          audiences—even before they grasp the underlying concept.
